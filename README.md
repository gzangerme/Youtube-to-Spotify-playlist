# YoutubetoSpotifyPlaylist

This project is based on The Come Up video on how to automate the process of adding your "Liked" music videos on Youtube to a playlist on Spotify.

## The Idea

Taking the previous project as an base, I added the feature of not only add the Liked videos from YT, but giving the choice for the user to put any playlist Id from the Youtube and transform it into a Spotify Playlist.

## Technologies

- [Youtube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)

Used to access and manage Youtube actions, such as access to playlists and metadate of each video.

- [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)

Used to get permissions such as creation of playlists,search for musics and add then to the created playlist.

- [Youtube DL](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/)

Used to download some Youtube data on each video.
